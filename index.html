          <div class="post-content">
            <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be able
              to make a <strong>website</strong>, I would not have believed
               them.</p>
            <p>Just a few days later, I came across <em>Mimo</em> and started to
               work on a real blog.The website
               <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_class.asp">
               w3schools</a> helped me along with it.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I started acting when I was 2O years old and do not regret it.
              I first was shy from the fact that people will talk that it's to
              late.</p>
            <p>But that was the best thing I could have done. It's an investment
              on myself. Good luck with wht you are doing!</p>
